# **INSTRUCTION :**
``` python
- Remain the application to consist of only one HTML5 Canvas.
- Redefine the vertices data of the two digits and two alphabets so they are extruded into 3D objects. In other words, equip the vertices data with z values.
- With the help of glMatrix library:
- Set the camera's perspective with a field of view of 75 degrees, a square aspect ratio, a near clip of 0.5, and a far clip of 50.0.
- Set the camera's z-position 7.5 units back from the origin, yet keep the camera looking at the origin.
- (Automatically) Translate the first digit object horizontally, bouncing back between the right and left edges of the canvas with a speed of 0.0xxx units per frame where xxx is the last three digits of your student ID.
- (Automatically) Scale the second digit object, bouncing back between its half-size and double-size with a scaling speed of your choice (it's up to you).
- (Interactively) Rotate the first alphabet about the Y axis with an angular speed of your choice (it's up to you) when the left or right arrow key is pressed.
- (Interactively) Rotate the second alphabet about the X axis with an angular speed of your choice (it's up to you) when the up or down key is pressed
```
